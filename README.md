# Webcomponents Example Website
This is an example of utilizing browser native WebComponents functionalities to build whole website without any libraries rather than using it for a single component to be distributed independently.

### Demo
[live demo](https://lyonish.github.io/webcomponents-example-website/)

To run the project locally, clone this repository and then,

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Notes
With Github Pages, `server.js` can't be utilized therefore initial access must be just `/`, but when you run this locally, other paths `/`, `/blog`, `/about` are acceptable to access.

### Advice/Contribution
Feel free to open an issue when you find some improvements.
